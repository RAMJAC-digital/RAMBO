## [Zig Build System](zig-0.15.1.md#toc-Zig-Build-System) <a href="zig-0.15.1.md#Zig-Build-System" class="hdr">§</a>

The Zig Build System provides a cross-platform, dependency-free way to declare
the logic required to build a project. With this system, the logic to build
a project is written in a build.zig file, using the Zig Build System API to
declare and configure build artifacts and other tasks.

Some examples of tasks the build system can help with:

- Performing tasks in parallel and caching the results.
- Depending on other projects.
- Providing a package for other projects to depend on.
- Creating build artifacts by executing the Zig compiler. This includes
  building Zig source code as well as C and C++ source code.
- Capturing user-configured options and using those options to configure
  the build.
- Surfacing build configuration as [comptime](zig-0.15.1.md#comptime) values by providing a
  file that can be [imported](zig-0.15.1.md#import) by Zig code.
- Caching build artifacts to avoid unnecessarily repeating steps.
- Executing build artifacts or system-installed tools.
- Running tests and verifying the output of executing a build artifact matches
  the expected value.
- Running `zig fmt` on a codebase or a subset of it.
- Custom tasks.

To use the build system, run <span class="kbd">zig build --help</span>
to see a command-line usage help menu. This will include project-specific
options that were declared in the build.zig script.
