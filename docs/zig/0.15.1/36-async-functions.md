## [Async Functions](zig-0.15.1.md#toc-Async-Functions) <a href="zig-0.15.1.md#Async-Functions" class="hdr">§</a>

Async functions regressed with the release of 0.11.0. The current plan is to
reintroduce them as a lower level primitive that powers I/O implementations.

Tracking issue: [Proposal: stackless coroutines as low-level primitives](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23446)
