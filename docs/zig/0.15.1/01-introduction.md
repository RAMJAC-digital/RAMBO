## [Introduction](zig-0.15.1.md#toc-Introduction) <a href="zig-0.15.1.md#Introduction" class="hdr">§</a>

[Zig](https://ziglang.org) is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining
**robust**, **optimal**, and **reusable** software.

Robust  
Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.

Optimal  
Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.

Reusable  
The same code works in many environments which have different
constraints.

Maintainable  
Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and
other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is
resilient to changing requirements and environments.

Often the most efficient way to learn something new is to see examples, so
this documentation shows how to use each of Zig's features. It is
all on one page so you can search with your browser's search tool.

The code samples in this document are compiled and tested as part of the main test suite of Zig.

This HTML document depends on no external files, so you can use it offline.
