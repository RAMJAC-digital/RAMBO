# Hardware Accuracy

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
- `h-fix-vblank-subcycle-timing.md` - Fix CPU/PPU sub-cycle execution order for VBlank flag timing
- `h-refactor-ppu-shift-register-rewrite.md` - Rewrite PPU to model cycle-accurate shift register behavior, fixing scanline 0 crash and mid-frame register bugs
- `h-fix-oam-nmi-accuracy.md` - Fix OAM DMA, NMI, and VBlank timing accuracy (AccuracyCoin tests, hardware spec verification)
- `h-research-mesen2-design-patterns.md` - Research Mesen2 design patterns and architecture to identify improvement opportunities for RAMBO (focus: PPU/NMI/OAM patterns)
